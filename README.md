# Login System
I developed this project as a todo project to develop my familiarity with web development. The system is capable of signing up a new user to the website and securely storing it's credentials using hasing mechanism to the database. User can login using either of thier username or email. I have carefully focused into the security of the system hence the system is secure from the classical sql injection attack(using sqli prepared statements).
